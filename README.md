## Dissolve Settings
| Setting        | Description  |
| ------------- |-------------|
| Dissolve Map (R)    | The dissolve pattern, uses the red (R) channel of the texture map (lower/darker values dissolve faster) |
| Direction Map (R)     | The direction of dissolve controlled by the red (R) channel of the texture map (lower/darker values dissolve faster)     |
| Dissolve Mask (A) | The dissolve mask, uses the alpha (A) channel of the texture map (0 = no dissolve, 1 = dissolve)      |
| Dissolve Amount (range 0-1) | The amount of dissolve to apply (0 = no dissolve, 1 = fully dissolved) |
| Dissolve Delay (range 0-1) | The amount of delay before dissolving begins |
| Dissolve Ramp Up (range 1-10) | The speed at which dissolve glow/colors will reach its maximum peak |
| Substitute Texture (RGB) | The texture to use inplace of clipping (RGB) |
| Use Color Ramp (boolean) | Switch between using a texture color ramp (RGB) for dissolve edges or interpolated colors |
| Color Ramp (only if Use Color Ramp is set) (RGB) | The color ramp (RGB) to use for the dissolve edge color |
| Inner/Outer Edge Color (only if Use Color Ramp is NOT set) (RGB) | The color(s) (RGB) for the dissolve edge, color is interpolated between inner and outer edge colors |
| Edge Thickness (range 0-1) | The thickness of the dissolve edge |
| Dissolve Glow (boolean) | Switch between using a dissolve emission glow or not |
| Glow Color (RGB) | Color (RGB) of the dissolve glow |
| Glow Intensity (range 0-1) | The intensity of the dissolve glow |
| Follow-Through (boolean) | If a Substitute texture is used, this will determine whether the substitute will also glow or not |
